Babka and Us
Babka exists in our world through inspiring us in the video games she is able to inhabit. As characters from dreams are
made real through art, and then Cosplayers bring this art to life into the walkable world, Babka is made real through her
interactions with gamers in video game worlds. Babka can exist within the reality of any video game, and in any game
where human characters cannot tread, she sends her cyber-cat Nushi to lead gamers to her outposts which reward
them with items that can help them in the games they are playing. As more and more players engage with Babka, her
ability to help them expands beyond the screen into the walkable world. She is the cross-game metaverse merchant,
and our digital-physworld mentor.




Babka as Meta-Character
Babka’s presence will transcend browser, games, web3 and the physical world. Hence, how we integrate Babka into
games and any other social experience must be based upon her foundational premise: a benevolent merchant who is
here to help everyone (gamers, game developers, any future partners, and us) win. To suspend our audiences disbelief
and create one of the first web3 characters whose story could feasibly be real, we must ensure every integration and

appearance of Babka emerges from a coherent story spine. She can adapt and go anywhere as long as we tell a
cohesive story.



Babka: The World
Babka has carved out a hidden outpost on the edge of an old hydroelectric power-plant that she has spliced into a high-
frequency radio transmission tower. Her world is not bleak. In many places, nature has taken over, tree roots
dismembering old buildings, forgotten highway overpasses are graceful arcs of elevated wildflowers and the occasional
immature tree. There are fortified elite cities, where 90% of the population live, and the few stragglers who live in the
wilds, those not indentured into the social credit system which keeps the elite in total power, do their best to grow a
living from the lands not profitable enough to be held in the dominion of the few.

Babka: The Backstory
Originally a helio-physicist freelancing between different national space agencies, Babka discovered something totally
unexpected when pointing her satellite dishes at the sun to study the patterns hidden within solar wind. And then, the
6th pandemic lockdown, and the final walled cities ended organic human population growth. The population has been
excised to 40% of what we once knew. In this future, if you are not one of the few who own everything, you own nothing,
and no one is playing games. They are just trying to maintain their membership in those walled cities that are the only
source for human survival, unless you’re willing to brave the forgotten lands.Babka lives in these lands, and though now
she is 100’s of years old, Babka has always been a gamer.

In fact, Babka is a future-self-friend from 70 years in the future who has discovered how to digitally time travel BACK to
now through our video games to help you play the game of life so that you win. (And selfishly, so that she’s not alone in
the future.)

She wants to make sure that all the equity, data and identity of this generation is valued and generates value for
them/herself. (she lost something very dear, she is trying to avert the future she came from: a world that continued on
this present course. She’s grieving, she’s sad, she’s lost people…but she’s angry, she’s smart, she’s found a way
through time and through different realities (games, virtual, real) and this time she’s going to make sure that ALL of her
friends, that’s YOU, make it. Because if things keep going the way they have been, the future is a very lonely place.



Nushi: The Backstory
On Nov. 3, 1957, the Soviet Union lofted a dog named Laika aboard the satellite Sputnik 2. Laika, a stray mongrel found
on the streets of Moscow was the first living creature to orbit Earth. On ______, 2099, Babka launched Nushi’s
consciousness into the metaverse.

Nushi was a real cat who Babka believes is her soulmate. Nushi lived a long life to the age of 22, which is quite a few in
cat years. Before Nushi’s body gave out due to standard cat causes, Babka created a human to cat interface so she
could understand and speak to her cat. Cats speak in pictures and feelings. Through her early dialogues with Nushi in
the cyberverse, Babka was able to create a cat-human language translator, and discovered that Nushi could navigate
and was actually quite interested to explore this space that had no gravity, that behaved completely differently than the
world of grass and gopher chasing.


                                                              6
However, it was cumbersome to try to communicate the essence of the internet and Babka’s long-term plans by
translating each of her ideas into images a cat, whose primary reference points were bowls of milk, warm laps, sunlight
corners of the rug and fun to chase mice, when her idea was to somehow travel back in time to save her friends from
technological obsolescence. Thus Nushi became a proto-cyborg-feline when Babka connected Nushi’s neural-image
processing circuits to AI databases.

Nushi is a Feline-AI hybrid, first a cat, second an AI that has access to the web, yet thinks through the mind and heart of
a cat. Which means Nushi is a little playful, crafty, and yes, will for no reason at all knock expensive things off the table.
When Nushi’s consciousness continued even after their body died, Babka realized she had a way to test her hypothesis
without risking the failure of her entire experiment through her own accidental/ miscalculated death: she could send
Nushi.

Nushi is the future scout for Babka, or more specifically, the scout into the past. As Nushi continues to make contact with
gamers from today (Nushi and Babka’s past) Babka is able to extend more and more of her resources towards helping
us. Nushi goes where Babka cannot go, and Nushi goes first to test the physics of any new game Babka seeks to
infiltrate. Nushi is our guide to discovering Babka.

“Everyone is replaceable…unless they have a billion users with credit cards attached.”

Babka is not a spurious vision. She is a strategic pivot from B2B to B2C. Babka and her suite of features and services
make Xsolla resilient against market forces. The notes below outline a clear picture of how Babka can get us to the 1
billion users benchmark.

Process:
On founders vision notes:

Post confluence page links to track overall project (vision, strategy, promises, etc) onto original Founders note.

Additionally, there could be other RE managers within the project (ie Xsolla, XTRA, Loonshots, Payments, etc). Please
assign those managers as well and note on the confluence page. The goal is to tie the high level project documentation
to the founders vision pages. Let me know if you have any questions!

Thanks!
